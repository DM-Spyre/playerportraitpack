This portraits folder contains Mobile friendly KTX image resources for the Arelith Player Portrait Pack Workshop Item.

The Arelith Player Portrait Pack is an optional unofficial portrait download for the Arelith Persistant server, and is not considered a "server official" portrait back, but a player pack allowing the player community a consensus on a large expansion of player portrait variety and filenames. The portrait pack is maintained by Spyre, with assistance from Symphony and Salmon.
