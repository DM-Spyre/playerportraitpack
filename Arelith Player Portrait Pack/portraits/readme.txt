This portraits folder contains NWN ready image resources for the Arelith Player Portrait Pack Workshop Item.

These files may appear upside-down because NWN files, such as PLT's, TGA's, and DDS files, are all upside-down, since NWN's OpenGL engine has an "inverted Y axis".

Some TGA's that work in NWN appear to work in NWN and are "right side up". That is because these files have a flag in their file header that tells other programs and thumbnail viewers to read them from the bottom, instead of the top. NWN doesn't check for this flag, so it prints them upside-down as they are stored without the flag, and upside-down appears correct in the game.

The Arelith Player Portrait Pack is an optional unofficial portrait download for the Arelith Persistant server, and is not considered a "server official" portrait back, but a player pack allowing the player community a consensus on a large expansion of player portrait variety and filenames. The portrait pack is maintained by Spyre, with assistance from Symphony and Salmon.
